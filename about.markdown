If you pick a lesson from this website, it's something that I personally know how to teach.

Upcoming topics (maybe):

- Linked Lists
- Hash Tables
- Binary Search
- Taking complicated sounding problem and turning it into one of these things.
- Map reduce
- Maybe GraphQL
- Gang-of-Four design patterns that are now super mainstream
