title:  "Web app speed - Navigating a React app in the Chrome profiler and evaluating server HTTP speed"
---

Learning goals:

1. Be able to state the meaning of at least two web page performance metrics that Chrome can evaluate.

2. Be able to state at least one server-side technique that can make a page load faster.

3. Be able to find a function in the Chrome JS profiler that is slowing down page rendering.

Future learning goals may include other specific performance ideas.

Estimated time: 60 minutes.

Recommendation:

1. Read this article: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/speed/get-started

2. Make sure to fork the "glitch" project and follow along with the article.

3. Discuss the learning goals with the instructor.

The web page has a video, so you could watch the video instead. I think it's fine to watch the
video first, but you should really do the work yourself.
