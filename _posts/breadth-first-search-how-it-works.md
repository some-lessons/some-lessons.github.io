title:  "Breadth-first search - Lesson 1 - Explaining how it works"
---

Learning goals:

1. Be able to state in what order breadth-first search examines nodes in a tree.

2. Be able to read a breadth-first algorithm and explain how it works.

Future learning goals may include being able to write it from scratch, but I believe that's another lesson.

Recommendation:

1. Read this article: https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/javascript/bfs

2. Open your code editor, and skip to the code in this article -- https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-magicians-guide-to-algorithms-part-4-the-breadth-first-search-b800aec8ccf8 -- and literally type it in, and figure out how to run it. (Note: there's a useless for loop in that code. Delete it.)

3. Discuss how the code works with the instructor.
